# code challenge 1

Given an integer n, find the difference between the sums of its even and odd digits.

Example:
For n = 412, the output should be solution(n) = 5.

- The even digits are 4 and 2 and the odd digit is 1. Therefore (4 + 2) - (1) = 5

For n = 1203, the output should be solution(n) = -2

- The even digits are 2 and 0 and the odd digits are 1 and 3. Therefore (2+0) - (1+3) = -2
